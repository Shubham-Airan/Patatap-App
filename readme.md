This project illustrates power of libraries in building interesting apps very fast

Libraries Used:
1. Paper.js     for nice circle animations
2. Howler.js    for getting and playing individual sound for each keypress


How to run:
just open the app and type any letter from a-z on keyboard.

This keypress will have following effects:
Each keypress will result in circles shrinking down
Location of circle also changes for each key press
Each keypress will have its individual sound and individual color
